## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to ensure maintainability and scalability:

```

## Authentication Flow

The application implements a robust authentication system using **Firebase Authentication**:

1.  **Registration**: Users can create new accounts via the `RegisterScreen`. Firebase handles the user creation.
2.  **Login**: Existing users can log in via the `LoginScreen`. Firebase authenticates the user.
3.  **Session Management**: The application state is managed using Riverpod, which listens to Firebase authentication state changes.
4.  **User State**: The user's information is fetched from the backend API and stored within Riverpod providers.
5.  **Logout**: Users can log out, which signs them out of Firebase and clears the application state.
6.  **Role-Based Features**: User roles are fetched from the backend and used to control access to features like the Admin Dashboard and publishing news.

## API Keys Setup

This project requires API keys for Firebase and the backend news API.

1.  **Backend API URL**:
    *   The backend API base URL is configured in `lib/services/api_service.dart`.
        ```dart
        static const String _baseUrl = 'https://jante-chaii.vercel.app/api';
        ```
    *   If you are running your own backend, update this URL accordingly.

2.  **Firebase Setup**:
    *   You need to set up a new Firebase project.
    *   Configure your Android/iOS apps in the Firebase console.
    *   Download the `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) and place them in the appropriate directories (`android/app` and `ios/Runner` respectively).
    *   The `firebase_options.dart` file should be generated by the FlutterFire CLI.
